datasets:
  # This dataset (external_detrended) is the important one: these files should
  # contain the detrended images produced by some other pipelines, and we'll
  # put code in hsc.importExtData.ExternalImage.readFits() to read them into
  # lsst.afw.image.ExposureF objects.  Once that works, we should be able to
  # run slightly-modified versions of the regular LSST tasks to process them
  # into a form suitable for coaddition.

    # This is not actually a catalog; this is a small hack to tell the Butler
    # to call ExternalImage.readFits() (which we can make do whatever we want).
    # We will need to find a way to encode the true camera in the visit number
    # in a way that will avoid conflicts with actual HSC visit numbers and
    # allow us to determine the camera from this number later.
